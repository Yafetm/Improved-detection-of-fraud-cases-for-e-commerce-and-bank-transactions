# Improved Detection of Fraud Cases for E-commerce and Bank Transactions

## Overview
This project is part of the 10 Academy KAIM Week 8&9 challenge. It focuses on building machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in e-commerce and bank datasets. This repository contains code for data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Yafetm/Improved-detection-of-fraud-cases-for-e-commerce-and-bank-transactions.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place the datasets (`Fraud_Data.csv`, `IpAddress_to_Country.csv`, `creditcard.csv`) in the `data/` folder.
4. Run the scripts in the `scripts/` folder for data preprocessing and analysis.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets (not tracked in Git).
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
